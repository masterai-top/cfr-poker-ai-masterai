MasterAI v3.0 is a game-AI research project for **Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold'em (HUNL)**. It explores Counterfactual Regret Minimization, self-play reinforcement learning, deep neural networks, counterfactual value estimation, and online strategy re-solving.


> This project is intended for research and education in game theory, imperfect-information games, and multi-agent decision making. Do not use it for activities that violate applicable law, platform rules, or third-party rights.


## Project Scope


| Area | Relevant repository components |
| --- | --- |
| CFR and game trees | `csrc/`, regret data, abstraction, and tree-search components |
| Poker rules | Game logic, action spaces, and state handling under `game/` |
| Counterfactual values | Counterfactual value computation under `cfv/` |
| Reinforcement learning | `rela/`, `supervised_strategy/`, and training entry points |
| Opponents and bots | `robot/`, self-play, and opponent strategy components |
| Service integration | `ipc/`, `proto/`, `redis/`, room logic, and Python services |
| Evaluation | `benchmark/`, `tests/`, and project-reported performance data |


## Core Technology


| Component | Research approach |
| --- | --- |
| Core algorithms | CFR-family methods, regret matching, and average strategies |
| Game type | HUNL, a two-player zero-sum imperfect-information game |
| Learning | Self-play, supervised strategies, and reinforcement-learning components |
| State evaluation | Deep neural networks and counterfactual value estimates |
| Online decisions | Public-state modeling, local search, and continual re-solving concepts |
| Engineering | C++ computation, Python orchestration, IPC, Protobuf, and Redis components |


Tabular CFR has regret-convergence properties under specific assumptions in finite two-player zero-sum games. With function approximation, abstraction, pruning, and online search, convergence and performance depend on the implementation, training process, and evaluation protocol; they cannot be inferred from the algorithm name alone.

## Benchmark Status


The previous README reported the following results:


| Opponent | Project-reported win rate |
| --- | ---: |
| Random Bot | 85% |
| Rule-based AI | 72% |
| CFR Baseline | 58% |


These figures are **project-reported values from the previous repository documentation and were not independently reproduced during this documentation update**. Before citing or comparing them, record the commit, random seeds, opponent implementation, blinds, stack depth, hand count, hardware, confidence intervals, and raw logs. See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) and [REPRODUCIBILITY.md](REPRODUCIBILITY.md).


## Evaluation Workflow


The repository combines C++, Python, shell scripts, Protobuf, Redis, and historical components. Do not run example commands in production before validating dependencies and parameters.


Recommended evaluation sequence:


1. Read `LICENSE`, `License.md`, the configuration directory, and each script, then confirm the applicable license terms with the maintainer.
2. Create an isolated Linux test environment and verify Python, the C++ compiler, CMake, PyTorch, Redis, and third-party library versions.
3. Inspect the real parameters and paths in `main.py`, `run.py`, `train.sh`, and `deploy.sh`.
4. Run minimal tests and small benchmarks before estimating full training resources.
5. Record the commit hash, configuration, seeds, hardware, data, model artifacts, and raw output.

## License and Responsible Use


The root [LICENSE](LICENSE) does not currently contain a recognizable complete license text, while the repository also has `License.md`. This creates licensing ambiguity. Before use, distribution, or commercial adoption, ask the maintainer to identify and provide the authoritative license.


[RESPONSIBLE-USE.md](RESPONSIBLE-USE.md) is a policy and risk notice, not a software license. Users remain responsible for applicable law, platform rules, privacy, and data protection.
